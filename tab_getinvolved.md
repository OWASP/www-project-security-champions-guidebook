# Next Steps
As you can imagine, a project like this is not done after its first publication. We’re super proud we are finally online with our manifesto after working on it for a while with our project team. But we know we aren’t done yet!

Our current roadmap focuses mostly on expanding the manifesto. This will be with a why-how-what approach. So explaining why you need something and what we envision that looks like, followed by hows: where can you start. Lastly it would be great to offer some anonymized and general decks, docs, whatever you need to achieve a certain principle.

# Get Involved
If you are running a Security Champions Program, or starting one, reach out! Let’s talk, see where we can help and most importantly: if you used anything from us, let us know if that worked for you!

If you have a platform where we can talk about our Security Champions Program and would like to offer a collaboration or publication, reach out too! This really helps drive the message.

# Updates
Follow these pages to get instantly updated when we publish new things. We don’t have a set update schedule (yet), but will be publishing as often as possible when we improve things.
