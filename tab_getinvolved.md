# Get Involved
If you are running a Security Champions Program, or starting one, reach out! Let’s talk, see where we can help and most importantly: if you used anything from us, let us know if that worked for you!

It would be great to receive contributions in the form of (anonymized) presentations, program documents or whatever can be useful in achieving a certain principle.

If you have a platform where we can talk about our Security Champions Program and would like to offer a collaboration or publication, reach out too! This really helps drive the message.

# Updates
Follow these pages to get instantly updated when we publish new things. We don’t have a set update schedule but will be publishing as often as possible when we improve things.
