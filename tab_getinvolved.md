# Get Involved

# Call for Security Champions Artifacts!
The OWASP SCG Committee is looking for contributions in the form of artifacts and interviews. These can be (anonymized) presentations, program documents, or whatever tools have been useful to your organization.

For example:
* Program Charters
* KPIs & Metrics
* Training Materials
* Guidelines & Best Practices
* Success Stories & Case Studies
* See more artifact types and their descriptions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eZHaBUMBxHmSLTVAhdaGVvZNl3MP5Fe-UCNFBuyY9RA/edit?usp=sharing)!

We’re collecting data from companies worldwide that have Security Champions Programs at any stage of maturity (including wishful thinking!). Please contact us ([Irfaan Santoe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irfaansantoe/), [Marisa Fagan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marisafagan/), [Aleksandra Kornecka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandrakornecka/)) to set up a time to meet and donate.
