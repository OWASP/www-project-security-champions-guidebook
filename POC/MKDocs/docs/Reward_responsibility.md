## What

The principle of "Reward Responsibility" involves establishing a system within an organization to recognize and reward the efforts of Security Champions. This system is designed to encompass both tangible and intangible forms of recognition and rewards. It aims to acknowledge the contributions that Security Champions make in enhancing the security posture of the organization, including their dedication, innovations, and proactive measures in managing security-related issues.

## Why

Acknowledging and rewarding Security Champions is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it serves as a significant motivator, encouraging continued enthusiasm and dedication in their roles. When individuals see their efforts being recognized, they are more likely to take ownership and be proactive in their security responsibilities. Additionally, a reward system contributes to the overall effectiveness of the Security Champions program by fostering a positive and encouraging environment. It also plays a key role in talent retention within the program, as it demonstrates the organization's appreciation and value for the commitment and efforts of its Security Champions.

## How

To effectively implement this principle, organizations should develop a system that regularly recognizes the efforts of Security Champions. This could include setting up formal recognition programs, offering tangible rewards such as bonuses or professional development opportunities, and providing career advancement possibilities for effective champions. Additionally, regular feedback and expressions of appreciation are essential. Tailoring rewards to individual motivations is also key; some Champions might value public recognition, while others might appreciate personal development opportunities. The system should be designed to align with the organization's culture and policies, ensuring that it is meaningful and sustainable.
