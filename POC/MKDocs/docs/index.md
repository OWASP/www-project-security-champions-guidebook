**Welcome to the home of the OWASP Security Champions Guide Project! Our goal is to create an open-source, vendor-neutral guidebook for AppSec professionals to help them build and improve their own successful Security Champion programs.**

One size will not fit all – so this playbook is designed for you to pick and choose the elements your organization can adopt or leverage to create your own customized program. We will provide customizable artifacts that can be used to start or improve your program. It doesn’t stop there! As your program matures, the playbook will provide you with next steps and new factors for consideration to further empower your program and your champions.

To make this happen, our project team is interviewing security leaders, program coordinators, and security champions to establish what makes a successful program. Participants represent a range of company sizes, industries, geographies, and also different levels of security program maturity. We want to know what works, what doesn’t work, what promotes success, and what leads to failure.

We are looking for more participants to take part in this exciting project. Whatever your experience of Security Champions programs – good or bad – we want to hear from you! Especially if you are/have been:

- A security champion
- A program leader
- A CISO or executive in an organization with experience of Security Champions programs
