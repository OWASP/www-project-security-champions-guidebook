</p>

**Why**

Ensure the people involved in your security champion program are passionate about security. This passion helps to drive the program further and boost the security culture.

**What**

Being passionate about security is crucial because it creates a mindset where security is not just a compliance requirement, but a fundamental part of how an organization operates. When employees are passionate about security, they are more likely to take ownership of security issues, be proactive about identifying potential risks, and advocate for security best practices throughout the organization.

**How**

Promote security top down and on all levels within your organization. Show security is taken seriously by management and is a key element of the DNA of the company. Then explain the importance of the security champions program within your organization. It should be clear what the program brings and what is expected of the people involved. The employees with passion for security should naturally be attracted to the program and raise their voice. Start with recruiting those volunteers and avoid assigning security champions when possible. 

Be sure to enable passionate champions and invest in keeping them onboard. Trigger their curiosity and offer opportunities to keep on growing no matter what level they are on. Ideally, they also drive the program forward and make sure it covers their needs.

Donâ€™t limit yourself to internal recruitment. Highlight the importance of security in your vacancies to attract passionate people that can boost the security culture. Ask candidates about their security experience and see if you can find that spark.
